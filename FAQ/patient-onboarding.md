 
# Introduction:
As more business open their doors, you might be asked to provide information about your last COVID-19 test or whether you have received a COVID-19 vaccination. While you could show your CDC vaccination card, now there’s a new way to share your information with those that need it: the SMART Health Card. A SMART Health Card enables you to receive and share your COVID-19 vaccination status or test results with others of your choosing. Unlike a paper card, a SMART Health Card is “verifiable,” so if you choose to use it, the information can be trusted. 
 
## What's a SMART Health Card?
A SMART Health Card contains information about you:
* Your legal name, date of birth, and country. 
* Your COVID-19 lab test, when it was performed, the test manufacturer, and if the results were positive or negative.
* Details about your COVID-19 vaccination, including the date on which you received the vaccination and the manufacturer. 
 
## Where do I get a SMART Health Card?
Any organization that has your information might be able to issue you a SMART Health Card. That might be the lab, clinic, pharmacy, or site where you got your COVID-19 vaccine or lab test. The place that gives you the card “signs” it digitally, which helps ensure the data is correct and hasn’t been tampered with.
 
## How can I use a SMART Health Card?
Your SMART Health Card contains information about you. You control who your SMART Health Card is shared with and how it’s shared. You might receive a SMART Health Card printed on a piece of paper or electronically from your doctor's office.
 
On paper, your SMART Health Card contains your information, including a barcode; it will look something like this:

 Your information might be in more than one barcode, and all barcodes must be scanned to share all of your COVID-19 information. If you allow your barcodes to be scanned, you are sharing the information in your SMART Health Card. If you tear up your paper barcode, the information is destroyed. 
 
You might also have access to your SMART Health Card barcodes through a website or an app on your phone. You can choose to print these barcodes yourself or let someone scan the barcode right from your personal device. By allowing a person to scan your barcode, you are sharing information about you and your COVID-19 status. 
 
You might be able to export your SMART Health Card from one app on your smartphone to another. By exporting or sharing your SMART Health Card with other apps on your phone, you're sharing information about you and your COVID-19 status with those apps.

## How do SMART Health Cards protect my privacy?
You are in control of sharing, or not sharing, your SMART Health Card. If you have a printed SMART Health Card, you can destroy the piece of paper. If you have a SMART Health Card on your phone, you control with whom you share your data. You control if you want to download your SMART Health Card into an app of your choosing—or not.
 
SMART Health Cards contain only your name, date of birth, country, and information about your COVID-19 immunization or lab results. They do not contain your phone number, address, a government-issued identifier, or any other information about your health.
 
Your data is stored only within the barcode itself. It is not stored in any computer systems other than the system for the organization that gave you the barcode.
